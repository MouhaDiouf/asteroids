This app communicates with the Nasa API to display asteroids based on their IDs or date. It uses React on the front-end and Firebase on the backend. 

The user can create an account, browse through a list of asteroids, and add or remove asteroids from its favorites. The user can also have access to its favorite asteroids anytime he logs in.

## Description 
This is the last capstone project I built while being a software developer student at Microverse. It's a web application where the user can create an account, browse through available cars, and book cars for a date and location.

The web application uses React as the front-end language and Ruby on Rails as the back-end language. 

I built the Ruby On Rails backend API so that the two separate web apps can communicate smoothly.
